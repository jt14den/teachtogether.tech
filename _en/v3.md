This design follows the backward design process described in
[s:process](#CHAPTER).

## Brainstorming

*These questions and answers provide a rough scope for the material.*

1. What problems will learners learn how to solve?

   1. How people learn and what that tells us about how best to teach
      them (educational psychology, cognitive load, study skills).

   1. How to design and deliver instruction in computing skills
      (backward curriculum design, some pedagogical content knowledge
      for computing).

   1. How to deliver lessons (teaching as a performance art, live
      coding, motivation and demotivation, and automation).

   1. How to grow a teaching community (community organization and
      marketing).

1. What is out of scope?

   1. How to teach children or people with special learning needs.
      Much of what's in this material applies to those learners, but
      they have different or extra needs.

   1. How to rigorously assess the impact of training. Informal
      self-assessment will be included, but we will not try to explain
      how to do publishable scientific research in education.

   1. How to design and deliver entire degree programs and other
      extended curriculum. Again, much of what's in this material
      applies, but the extra needs of large-scale curriculum design is
      out of scope.

1. What concepts and techniques will learners encounter?

   1. 7Â±2 and chunking.

   1. Authentic tasks with tangible artifacts.

   1. Bloom's Taxonomy, Fink's Taxonomy, and Piaget's development
      stage theory.

   1. Branding.

   1. Cognitive development from novice to competent to expert.

   1. Cognitive load.

   1. Collaborative lesson development.

   1. Concept mapping.

   1. Designing assessments with diagnostic power.

   1. Dunning-Kruger effect.

   1. Expert blind spot.

   1. Externalized cognition.

   1. Fixed vs. growth mindset (and critiques of it).

   1. Formative vs. summative assessment.

   1. Governance models of community organizations.

   1. Inquiry-based learning (and critiques of it).

   1. Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation.

   1. *Jugyokenkyu* (lesson study).

   1. Learner personas.

   1. Legitimate peripheral participation in a community of practice.

   1. Live coding (teaching as a performance art).

   1. Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and technological
      pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK).

   1. Peer instruction.

   1. Reflective (deliberate) practice.

   1. Backward design.

   1. Stereotype threat (and critiques of it).

   1. Working memory vs. persistent memory.

1. What mistakes or misconceptions will they have?

   1. Children and adults learn the same way.

   1. Computing education should be for and about computer science.

   1. Programming skill is innate.

   1. Student evaluations of courses are indicative of learning
      outcomes.

   1. Teaching ability is innate.

   1. The best way to teach is to throw people in at the deep end.

   1. The best way to teach is to use "real" tools right from the
      start.

   1. Visual-auditory-kinesthetic (VAK) learning styles are real.

   1. Women just don't like programming or innately have less
      aptitude.

   1. Getting a (better) job is the main reason someone should learn
      how to program.

1. In what contexts will this material be used?

   1. Primary: an intensive weekend workshop for people in tech who
      want to volunteer with grassroots get-into-coding initiatives.

   1. Secondary: self-study or guided study by such people.

   1. Secondary: a one-semester undergraduate course for computer
      science majors interested in education.

## Intended Audience

*These learner personas clarify what readers are interested in and what
can be assumed about their prior knowledge.*

Emily
: trained as a librarian, and now works as a web designer and project
  manager in a small consulting company. In her spare time, she helps
  run web design classes for women entering tech as a second career.
  She is now recruiting colleagues to run more classes in her area
  using the lessons that she has created, and wants to know how to
  grow a volunteer teaching organization.

Moshe
: is a professional programmer with two teenage children whose school
  doesn't offer programming classes. He has volunteered to run a
  monthly after-school programming club, and while he frequently gives
  presentations to colleagues, he has no experience designing lessons.
  He wants to learn how to build effective lessons in collaboration
  with others, and is interested in turning his lessons into a
  self-paced online course.

Samira
: is an undergraduate in robotics who is thinking about becoming a
  full-time teacher after she graduates. She wants to help teach
  weekend workshops for undergraduate women, but has never taught an
  entire class before, and feels uncomfortable teaching things that
  she's not an expert in. She wants to learn more about education in
  general in order to decide if it's for her.

Gene
: is a professor of computer science whose research area is operating
  systems. They have been teaching undergraduate classes for six
  years, and increasingly believe that there has to be a better way.
  The only training available through their university's teaching and
  learning center relates to posting assignments and grades in the
  learning management system, so they want to find out what else they
  ought to be asking for.

Common elements:

- A variety of technical backgrounds and skills.

- May or may not have some teaching experience.

- No formal training in teaching, lesson design, or community
  organization.

- More likely to teach in free-range settings often than in
  institutional classrooms with required homework, final exams, and
  externally-mandated curriculum.

- Focused on teenagers and adults rather children.

- Limited time and resources (either because they are volunteers, or
  because their institution considers teaching a secondary
  responsibility).

Learning contexts:

Emily
: will take part in a weekly online reading group with her volunteers.

Moshe
: will cover part of this book in a two-day weekend workshop and study
  the rest on his own.

Samira
: will use this book in a one-semester undergraduate course with
  assignments, a project, and a final exam.

Gene
: will read the book on their own in their office or while commuting,
  wishing all the while that universities did more to support
  high-quality teaching.

## Course Overview

### Brief Description

Teaching isn't magic: good teachers are simply people who have learned
how to design lessons to achieve concrete goals, how to get and use
feedback from learners, and how to work well with other teachers. This
book will show you how to do these things and more, and will introduce
you to some of the research that explains why some things work and some
things don't. It is primarily intended for people in tech with no formal
training in teaching who want to help adults learn how to create web
sites, write programs, and analyze data, but the ideas apply equally
well to other groups in other settings.

### Learning Objectives

Learners will be able to...

1. Explain the cognitive changes that occur as people go from novice to
   competent to expert and how best to teach each group.

1. Explain how to design, construct, and maintain lessons in a
   systematic, collaborative way.

1. Design exercises to help correct key misconceptions that learners
   have about computing.

1. Summarize key elements of pedagogical content knowledge related to
   computing and other technical skills.

1. Compare and contrast teaching with other performance arts and
   participate in structured critiques of live teaching.

1. Compare and contrast interactive teaching, automated teaching, and
   hybrid models.

1. Describe factors that motivate or demotivate adult learners and how
   to take those into account when teaching.

1. Describe ways in which members of different groups are made to feel
   unwelcome or excluded in computing and what can be done to make
   computing more inclusive.

1. Explain the purpose and value of their teaching and of their
   community of practice.

1. Be a productive member of a community of teaching practice.

### Prerequisites

Some exercises will assume a small amount of programming knowledge:
readers should know how to loop over the elements of a list, how to take
action using an if-else statement, and how to write and call a simple
function.
