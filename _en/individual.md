The previous three chapters have looked at what instructors can do to
help their learners. This chapter looks at what learners can do for
themselves by changing their study strategies and getting enough rest.

The key to getting more out of learning is
[metacognition](#g:metacognition), or thinking about one's
own thinking processes. Just as good musicians listen to their own
playing, and good teachers reflect on their teaching
([s:performance](#CHAPTER)), learners will learn better and faster if
they make plans, set goals, and monitor their progress. It's difficult
for learners to master these skills in the abstract---for example, just
telling them to make plans doesn't have any effect---but lessons can be
designed to encourage certain study practices, and drawing attention to
these practices in class helps them realize that learning is a skill
that can be improved like any other [[McGu2015](#CITE),[Miya2018](#CITE)].

The big prize is transfer of learning, which occurs when one thing we
have learned helps us learn something else more quickly. Researchers
distinguish between [near transfer](#g:near-transfer), which occurs
between similar or related areas like fractions and decimals, or loops
in different programming languages, and [far
transfer](#g:far-transfer), which occurs between dissimilar
domains---the idea that learning to play chess will help mathematical
reasoning or vice versa.

Near transfer undoubtedly occurs---no kind of learning beyond simple
memorization could occur if it didn't---and instructors leverage it all
the time by giving learners exercises that are close in form or content
to what has just been presented in a lesson. However, [[Sala2017](#CITE)]
recently analyzed many studies of far transfer and concluded that while
we might *want* to believe in it:

> ...the results show small to moderate effects. However, the
> effect sizes are inversely related to the quality of the experimental
> design... We conclude that far transfer of learning rarely
> occurs.

When far transfer *does* occur, it seems to happen only once a subject
has been mastered [[Gick1987](#CITE)]. In practice, this means that
learning to program won't help you play chess and vice versa.

## Six Strategies {#s:individual-strategies}

Psychologists study learning in a wide variety of ways, but have
reached similar conclusions about what actually works
[[Mark2018](#CITE)]. The [Learning Scientists][learning-scientists]
have catalogued six of these strategies and summarized them in [a set
of downloadable posters][learning-scientists-downloads].  Teaching
these strategies to students, and mentioning them by name when you use
them in class, can help them learn how to learn faster and better
[[Wein2018](#CITE)].

### Spaced Practice

Ten hours of study spread out over five days is more effective than two
five-hour days, and far better than one ten-hour day. You should
therefore create a study schedule that spreads study activities over
time: block off at least half an hour to study each topic each day
rather than trying to cram everything in the night before an exam
[[Kang2016](#CITE)].

You should also review material after each class (but not immediately
after---take at least a half-hour break). When reviewing, be sure to
include at least a little bit of older material: for example, spend 20
minutes looking over notes from that day's class, and then 5 minutes
each looking over material from the previous day and from a week before.
(Doing this also helps you catch any gaps or mistakes in previous sets
of notes while there's still time to correct them or ask questions: it's
painful to realize the night before the exam that you have no idea why
you underlined "Demodulate!!" three times.)

When reviewing, make notes about things that you had forgotten: for
example, make a flash card for each fact that you couldn't remember, or
that you remembered incorrectly. This will help you focus the next round
of study on things that most need attention.

> **The Value of Lectures**
> 
> According to [[Mill2016a](#CITE)], "The lectures that predominate in
> face-to-face courses are relatively ineffective ways to teach, but
> they probably contribute to spacing material over time, because they
> unfold in a set schedule over time. In contrast, depending on how the
> courses are set up, online students can sometimes avoid exposure to
> material altogether until an assignment is nigh."

### Retrieval Practice

Researchers now believe that the limiting factor for long-term memory is
not retention (what is stored), but recall (what can be accessed).
Recall of specific information improves with practice, so outcomes in
real situations can be improved by taking practice tests or summarizing
the details of a topic from memory and then checking what was and wasn't
remembered. For example, [[Karp2008](#CITE)] found that repeated testing
improved recall of word lists from 35% to 80%.

Research also shows that recall is better when practice uses
activities similar to those used in testing; for example, writing
personal journal entries helps with multiple-choice quizzes, but less
than doing multiple-choice quizzes [[Mill2016a](#CITE)]. This is
called [transfer-appropriate
processing](#g:transfer-appropriate-processing).

One way to exercise retrieval skills is to solve problems twice. The
first time, do it entirely from memory without notes or discussion with
peers. After grading your own work against a rubric supplied by the
instructor, solve the problem again using whatever resources you want.
The difference between the two shows you how well you were able to
retrieve and apply knowledge.

Another method (mentioned above) is to create flash cards. In physical
form, a question or other prompt is written on one side, and the answer
is written on the other; in digital form, these are ideal for deployment
on mobile devices like phones. If you are studying as part of a group,
you can exchange flash cards with a partner; this also helps you
discover important ideas that you may have missed or misunderstood.

A quicker version of this is
[read-cover-retrieve](#g:read-cover-retrieve): as you read something,
cover up key terms or sections with small sticky notes. When you are
done, go through it a second time and see how well you can guess
what's under each of those stickies.

Whatever method you use, don't just practice recalling facts and
definitions: make sure you also check your understanding of big ideas
and the connections between them. Sketching a concept map and then
comparing it to your notes or to a previously-drawn concept map is a
quick way to do this.

> **Hypercorrection**
>

> confident someone is that they were right, the more likely they are
> not to repeat the error if they are corrected.

### Interleaving

One way you can space your practice is to interleave study of different
topics: instead of mastering one subject, then the next, then a third,
shuffle study sessions. Even better, switch up the order: A-B-C-B-A-C is
better than A-B-C-A-B-C, which in turn is better than A-A-B-B-C-C
[[Rohrer2015](#CITE)]. This is effective because interleaving fosters
creation of more links between different topics, which in turn increases
retention and recall.

How long you should spend on each item depends on the subject and how
well you know it, but somewhere between 10 and 30 minutes is long enough
for you to get into a state of flow ([s:individual-time](#SECTION)) but
not for your mind to wander. Interleaving study will initially feel
harder than focusing on one topic at a time, but that's a sign that it's
working. If you are making flash cards for yourself, or doing practice
tests, you should see improvement after only a couple of days.

### Elaboration

Explaining things to yourself as you go through them helps you
understand and remember them. One way to do this is to follow up each
answer on a practice quiz with an explanation of why that answer is
correct, or conversely with an explanation of why some other plausible
answer isn't. Another is to tell yourself how a new idea is similar to
or different from one that you have seen previously.

Talking to yourself may seem like an odd way to study, but
[[Biel1995](#CITE)] explicitly trained people in self-explanation, and
yes, they outperformed those who hadn't been trained. An exercise that
builds on this is to go through code line by line with a group, having a
different person to explain each line in turn and say why it is there
and what it accomplishes.

[[Chi1989](#CITE)] found that some learners simply halt when they hit an
unexplained step (or a step whose explanation they don't understand)
when doing mechanics problems in a physics class. Others who pause their
"execution" of the example to generate an explanation of what's going on
learn faster. Instructors should therefore demonstrate the latter
strategy to learners.

Explaining things to others even works on exams, though the extent of
the benefits are still being
studied. [[Cao2017a](#CITE),[Cao2017b](#CITE)] looked at two-stage
exams, i.e., a normal (individual) exam which is then immediately
followed by a second exam in which students work in small groups to
solve a set of problems. They found significant short-term gains for
students doing exams collaboratively, but not long-term gains, i.e.,
the benefits visible a couple of weeks after the mid-term had faded by
the final. They also found that students in the middle of the class
benefited strongly, and that homogeneous-ability groups benefited,
while heterogeneous groups did not.

### Concrete Examples

One specific form of elaboration is so useful that it deserves its own
heading, and that is the use of concrete examples. Whenever you have a
statement of a general principle, try to provide one or more examples of
its use, or conversely take each particular problem and list the general
principles it embodies. [[Raws2014](#CITE)] found that interleaving
examples and definitions made it more likely that learners would
remember the latter correctly.

One structured way to do this is the [ADEPT method][adept]: give an
**A**nalogy, draw a **D**iagram, present an **E**xample, describe the
idea in **P**lain language, and then give the **T**echnical details.
Again, if you are studying with a partner or in a group, you can swap
and check work: see if you agree that other people's examples actually
embody the principle being discussed, or which principles are used in
an example that they haven't listed.

Another useful technique is to teach by contrast, i.e., to show learners
what a solution is *not*, or what kind of problem a technique *won't*
solve. For example, when showing children how to simplify fractions,
it's important to give them a few like 5/7 that can't be simplified so
that they don't become frustrated looking for answers that don't exist.

### Dual Coding

The last of the six core strategies that the [Learning
Scientists][learning-scientists] describe is to present words and
images together. As discussed in [s:load-split-attention](#SECTION),
different subsystems in our brains handle and store linguistic and
visual information, and if complementary information is presented
through both channels, then they can reinforce one another. However,
learning is more effective when the same information is *not*
presented simultaneously in two different channels
[[Maye2003](#CITE)], because then the brain has to expend effort to
check the channels against each other.

One way to take advantage of dual coding is to draw or label timelines,
maps, family trees, or whatever else seems appropriate to the material.
(I am personally fond of pictures showing which functions call which
other functions in a program.) Drawing a diagram *without* labels, then
coming back later to label it, is excellent retrieval practice.

## Time Management {#s:individual-time}

I used to brag about the hours I was working. Not in so many words, of
course---I had *some* social skills---but I would show up for class around
noon, unshaven and yawning, and casually mention how I'd been up working
'til 6:00 a.m.

Looking back, I can't remember who I was trying to impress. Instead,
what I remember is how much of the work I did in those all-nighters I
threw away once I'd had some sleep, and how much damage the stuff I
didn't throw away did to my grades.

My mistake was to confuse "working" with "being productive". You can't
produce software (or anything else) without doing some work, but you can
easily do lots of work without producing anything of value. Convincing
people of this can be hard, especially when they're in their teens or
twenties, but pays tremendous dividends.

Scientific study of overwork and sleep deprivation goes back to at least
the 1890s (see [[Robi2005](#CITE)] for a short, readable summary). The
most important results for learners are:

1. Working more than eight hours a day for an extended period of time
   lowers your total productivity, not just your hourly
   productivity---i.e., you get less done in total (not just per hour)
   when you're in crunch mode than you do when you work regular hours.

1. Working over 21 hours in a stretch increases the odds of you making
   a catastrophic error just as much as being legally drunk.

1. Productivity varies over the course of the workday, with the
   greatest productivity occurring in the first four to six hours.
   After enough hours, productivity approaches zero; eventually it
   becomes negative.

These facts have been reproduced and verified for over a century, and
the data behind them is as solid as the data linking smoking to lung
cancer. The catch is that *people usually don't notice their abilities
declining*. Just like drunks who think they're still able to drive,
people who are deprived of sleep don't realize that they're not
finishing their sentences (or thoughts). Five eight-hour days per week
has been proven to maximize long-term total output in every industry
that has ever been studied; studying or programming are no different.

But what about short bursts now and then, like pulling an all-nighter to
meet a deadline? That has been studied too, and the results aren't
pleasant. Your ability to think drops by 25% for each 24 hours you're
awake. Put it another way, the average person's IQ is only 75 after one
all-nighter, which puts them in the bottom 5% of the population. Two all
nighters in a row, and their effective IQ is 50, which is the level at
which people are usually judged incapable of independent living.

"But---but---we have so many assignments to do!", your learners say. "And
they're all due at once! We *have* to work extra hours to get them all
done!" No: in order to be productive, they have to prioritize and
focus, and in order to do that, they have to be taught how. One
widely-used technique is to make a list of things that need to be done,
sort them by priority, and then switch off email and other interruptions
for 30-60 minutes and complete one of those tasks. If any task on a
to-do list is more than an hour long, break it down into smaller pieces
and prioritize those separately.

The most important part of this is switching off
interruptions. Despite what many people want to believe, people are
not good at multi-tasking.  What we can become good at is
[automaticity](#g:automaticity), which is the ability to do something
routine in the background while doing something else
[[Mill2016a](#CITE)]. Most of us can talk while chopping onions, or
drink coffee while reading; with practice, we can also take notes
while listening, but we can't study effectively, program, or do other
mentally challenging tasks while paying attention to something else.

The point of all this organization and preparation is to get into the
most productive mental state possible. Psychologists call it
[flow](#g:flow) [[Csik2008](#CITE)]; athletes call it "being in the
zone", while musicians talk about losing themselves in what they're
playing. Whatever name you use, people produce much more per unit of
time in this state than normal.

That's the good news. The bad news is that it takes roughly ten minutes
to get back into a state of flow after an interruption, no matter how
short the interruption was. This means that if you are interrupted half
a dozen times per hour, you are *never* at your productive peak.

## Peer Assessment {#s:individual-peer}

Asking people on a team to rate their peers is a common practice in
industry. [[Sond2012](#CITE)] surveyed the literature on student peer
assessment, distinguishing between grading and reviewing. The benefits
they found included increasing the amount, diversity, and timeliness of
feedback, helping students exercise higher-level thinking, encouraging
reflective practice, and supporting development of social skills. The
concerns were predictable: validity and reliability, motivation and
procrastination, trolls, collusion, and plagiarism. However, while these
concerns are legitimate, the evidence shows that they aren't significant
in class. For example, [[Kauf2000](#CITE)] compared confidential peer
ratings and grades on several axes for two undergraduate engineering
courses and found that self-rating and peer ratings statistically
agreed, that collusion (i.e., everyone giving their peers the same
grades) wasn't significant, that students didn't inflate their
self-ratings, and crucially, that ratings were not biased by gender or
race.

One important variation on peer assessment and review is [contributing
student pedagogy](#g:contributing-student), in which students produce
artifacts to contribute to other students' learning. This can be
developing a short lesson and sharing it with the class, adding to a
question bank, or writing up notes from a particular lecture for
in-class publication. For example, [[Fran2018](#CITE)] found that
students who made short videos to teach concepts to their peers had a
significant increase in their own learning compared to those who only
studied the material or viewed the videos.

Another is [calibrated peer review](#g:calibrated-peer-review), in
which a student reviews one or more examples using a rubric and
compares their evaluation against the instructor's review of the same
work [[Kulk2013](#CITE)]. Only once student's evaluations are close
enough to the instructor's are they allowed to start evaluating peers'
actual work.

As long as evaluation is based on observables, rather than personality
traits, peer assessment can actually be as accurate as assessment by TAs
and other outsiders. "Observables" means that instead of asking, "Is the
person outgoing," or "Does the person have a positive attitude,"
assessments should ask, "Does the person listen attentively during
meetings," or, "Does the person attempt to solve problems before asking
for help." The evaluation form in [s:peereval](#APPENDIX) shows a
sample to get you started. To use it, rank yourself and each of your
teammates, then calculate and compare scores.

## Exercises {#s:individual-exercises}

### Learning Strategies (individual/20)

1. Which of the six learning strategies do you regularly use? Which
   ones do you not?

1. Write down three general concepts that you want your learners to
   master, and then give two specific examples of each. (This uses the
   "concrete examples" practice).

1. For each of those concepts, work backward from one of your examples
   to explain how the concept explains it. (This uses the "elaboration"
   practice).

### Connecting Ideas (pairs/5)

This exercise is an example of using elaboration to improve
retention. Pick a partner, and have each person independently choose an
idea, then announce your ideas and try to find a four-link chain that
leads from one to the other. For example, if the two ideas are
"Saskatchewan" and "statistics", the links might be:

  - Saskatchewan is a province of Canada;

  - Canada is a country;

  - countries have governments;

  - governments are elected; and

  - people try to predict election results using statistics

### Convergent Evolution (pairs/15)

One practice that wasn't covered above is [guided
notes](#g:guided-notes), which are instructor-prepared notes that cue
students to respond to key information in a lecture or discussion. The
cues can be blank spaces where students add information, asterisks
next to terms students should define, etc.

Create 2--4 guided note cards for a lesson you have recently taught or
are going to teach. Swap cards with your partner: how easy is it to
understand what is being asked for? How long would it take to fill in
the prompts?

### Changing Minds (pairs/10)

[[Kirs2013](#CITE)] argues that myths about digital natives, learning
styles, and self-educators are all reflections of the mistaken belief
that learners know what is best for them, and cautions that we may be in
a downward spiral in which every attempt by education researchers to
rebut these myths confirms their opponents' belief that learning science
is pseudo-science. Pick one thing you have learned about learning so far
in this book that surprised you or contradicted something you previously
believed, and practice explaining it to a partner in 1--2 minutes. How
convincing are you?

### Flash Cards (individual/15)

Use sticky notes or anything else you have at hand to make up a dozen
flash cards for a topic you have recently taught or learned, trade with
a partner, and see how long it takes each of you to achieve 100% perfect
recall. When you are done, set the cards aside, then come back after an
hour and see what your recall rate is.

### Using ADEPT (whole class/15)

Pick something you have recently taught or been taught and outline a
short lesson that uses the five-step ADEPT method to introduce it.

### The Cost of Multi-Tasking (pairs/10)

[The Learning Scientists blog][learning-scientists-experiment]
describes a simple experiment you can do without preparation or
equipment other than a stopwatch to demonstrate the mental cost of
multi-tasking. Working in pairs, measure how long it takes each person
to do each of these three tasks:

  - Count from 1 to 26.

  - Recite the alphabet from A to Z.

  - Interleave the numbers and letters, i.e., say, "1, A, 2, B,
    ..." and so on.

Have each pair report their numbers: you will probably find that the
third (in which you are multi-tasking) takes significantly longer than
either of the component tasks.

### Myths in Computing Education (whole class/20)

[[Guzd2015b](#CITE)] presents a list of the top 10 mistaken beliefs
about computing education. His list of things that many people
believe, but which aren't true, includes the following:

1. The lack of women in Computer Science is just like all the other
   STEM fields.

1. To get more women in CS, we need more female CS faculty.

1. Student evaluations are the best way to evaluate teaching.

1. Good teachers personalize education for students' learning styles.

1. A good CS teacher should model good software development practice,
   because their job is to produce excellent software engineers.

1. Some people are just naturally better programmers than others.

Have everyone vote +1 (agree), -1 (disagree), or 0 (not sure) for each
point, then [read the full explanations in the original
article][guzdial-myths]) and vote again. Which ones did people change
their minds on? Which ones do they still believe are true, and why?

### Calibrated Peer Review (pairs/20)

1. Create a 5--10 point rubric for grading programs of the kind you
   would like your learners to write that has entries like "good
   variable names", "no redundant code", and "properly-nested control
   flow".

1. Choose or create a small program that contains 3--4 violations of
   these entries.

1. Grade the program according to your rubric.

1. Have your partner grade the same program with the same rubric. What
   do they accept that you did not? What do they critique that you did
   not?
