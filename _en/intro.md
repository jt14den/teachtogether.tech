Hundreds of grassroots groups have sprung up around the world to teach
programming, web design, robotics, and other skills to [free-range
learners](#g:free-range-learner) outside traditional classrooms. These
groups exist so that people don't have to learn these things on their
own, but ironically, their founders and instructors are often teaching
themselves how to teach.

There's a better way. Just as knowing a few basic facts about germs and
nutrition can help you stay healthy, knowing a few things about
psychology, instructional design, inclusivity, and community
organization can help you be a more effective teacher. This book
presents evidence-based practices you can use right now, explains why we
believe they are true, and points you at other resources that will help
you go further. Its four sections cover:

- how people learn;
- how to design lessons that work;
- how to deliver those lessons; and
- how to grow a community of practice around teaching.

Throughout, we try to follow our own advice: for example, we start with
ideas that are short, engaging, and actionable in order to motivate you
to read further ([s:motivation](#CHAPTER)), include lots of exercises
that can be used to reinforce learning ([s:models](#CHAPTER)), and
include the original design for this book in [s:v3](#APPENDIX) so that
you can see what a lesson design looks like.

## Who You Are {#s:intro-audience}

[s:process-personas](#SECTION) explains how to figure out who your
learners are. The four I had in mind when writing this book are all
[end-user teachers](#g:end-user-teacher): teaching isn't
their primary occupation, they have little or no background in pedagogy,
and they may work outside institutional classrooms.

Emily
: trained as a librarian, and now works as a web designer and project
  manager in a small consulting company. In her spare time, she helps
  run web design classes for women entering tech as a second career.
  She is now recruiting colleagues to run more classes in her area
  using the lessons that she has created, and wants to know how to
  grow a volunteer teaching organization.

Moshe
: is a professional programmer with two teenage children whose school
  doesn't offer programming classes. He has volunteered to run a
  monthly after-school programming club, and while he frequently gives
  presentations to colleagues, he has no experience designing lessons.
  He wants to learn how to build effective lessons in collaboration
  with others, and is interested in turning his lessons into a
  self-paced online course.

Samira
: is an undergraduate in robotics who is thinking about becoming a
  full-time teacher after she graduates. She wants to help teach
  weekend workshops for undergraduate women, but has never taught an
  entire class before, and feels uncomfortable teaching things that
  she's not an expert in. She wants to learn more about education in
  general in order to decide if it's for her.

Gene
: is a professor of computer science whose research area is operating
  systems. They have been teaching undergraduate classes for six
  years, and increasingly believe that there has to be a better way.
  The only training available through their university's teaching and
  learning center relates to posting assignments and grades in the
  learning management system, so they want to find out what else they
  ought to be asking for.

These people have *a variety of technical backgrounds* and *some
previous teaching experience*, but *no formal training in teaching,
lesson design, or community organization*. Most work with *free-range
learners* and are *focused on teenagers and adults* rather than
children; all *have limited time and resources*.

[s:joining-using](#SECTION) describes different ways people have used
this material. (That discussion is delayed to an appendix because it
refers to some of the ideas introduced later in this book.) We expect
our made-up learners to use this material as follows:

Emily
: will take part in a weekly online reading group with her volunteers.

Moshe
: will cover part of this book in a two-day weekend workshop and study
  the rest on his own.

Samira
: will use this book in a one-semester undergraduate course with
  assignments, a project, and a final exam.

Gene
: will read the book on their own in their office or while commuting,
  wishing all the while that universities did more to support
  high-quality teaching.

## What to Read Instead {#s:intro-instead}

If you are in a hurry, or want a taste of what this book will cover,
[[Brow2018](#CITE)] presents ten evidence-based tips for teaching
computing. You can download the paper, or read it online, on [the PLoS
website][brown-wilson-rules].

I also recommend:

- [The Carpentries instructor training][carpentries-training], for
  which most of the first half of this book was originally developed.

- [[Lang2016](#CITE)] and [[Hust2012](#CITE)], which are short,
  approachable, and connect things you can do right now to the
  research that backs them.

- [[Majo2015](#CITE)], [[Broo2016](#CITE)], [[Berg2012](#CITE)], and
  [[Rice2018](#CITE)]. The first catalogs a hundred different kinds of
  exercises you can do with students; the second describes fifty
  different ways that groups can discuss things productively, while
  the third is a collection of patterns for teaching, and the fourth
  explains why to give learners breaks in class and ways to use them
  productively. These books can be used on their own, but I think they
  make more sense once Huston or Lang have given you a framework for
  understanding them.

- [[DeBr2015](#CITE)], which conveys a lot of what *is* true about
  educational by explaining what *isn't*, and [[Dida2016](#CITE)],
  which grounds learning theory in cognitive psychology.

- [[Pape1993](#CITE)], which remains an inspiring vision of how
  computers could change education.

- [[Gree2014](#CITE)], [[McMi2017](#CITE)] and [[Watt2014](#CITE)]. These
  three short books explain why so many attempts at educational reform
  have failed over the past forty years, how for-profit colleges are
  exploiting and exacerbating the growing inequality in our society,
  and how technology has repeatedly failed to revolutionize education.

- [[Guzd2015a](#CITE)], [[Hazz2014](#CITE)], and [[Sent2018](#CITE)],
  which are academically-oriented books I've found useful about
  teaching computing.

- [[Brow2007](#CITE)] and [[Mann2015](#CITE)], because you can't teach
  computing well without changing the system in which we teach, and
  you can't do that on your own.

Of these, [[Pape1993](#CITE)] is the one that shaped my ideas about
teaching the most. Papert's central argument is that people don't
absorb knowledge; instead, they (re-)construct it for themselves, and
computers are a new and powerful tool for helping them do that. [Andy
Ko's excellent description][ko-papert] does a better job of
summarizing Papert's ideas than I possibly could, and
[[Craw2010](#CITE)] is a thought-provoking companion to both.

## History {#s:intro-history}

*A lot of my stories aren't true, but this is a true
story...*

When I started teaching people how to program in the late 1980s, I went
too fast, used too much jargon, and had no idea how much my learners
actually understood. I got better over time, but still felt like I was
stumbling around in a darkened room.

In 2010, I rebooted a project called [Software Carpentry][swc] that
teaches basic computing skills to researchers. (The name "carpentry"
was chosen to distinguish what we taught from software engineering: we
were trying to show people the digital equivalent of painting a
bathroom, not building the Channel Tunnel.) In the years that
followed, I discovered resources like [Mark Guzdial's
blog][guzdial-blog] and the book *How Learning Works*
[[Ambr2010](#CITE)]. These in turn led me to books like
[[Hust2012](#CITE),[Lemo2014](#CITE),[Lang2016](#CITE)] that showed me
how to build and deliver better lessons in less time and with less
effort.

I started using these ideas in [Software Carpentry][swc] in 2012. The
results were everything I'd hoped for, so I began running training
sessions to pass on what I'd learned. Those sessions became a
[training program][carpentries-training] that dozens of trainers have
now taught to over a thousand people on six continents.  Since then, I
have run the course for people who teach programming to children,
librarians, and women re-entering the workforce or changing careers,
and all of those experiences have gone into this book.

## Why Learn to Program? {#s:intro-why}

Politicians, business leaders, and educators often say that people
should learn to program because the jobs of the future will require it;
for example, [[Scaf2017](#CITE)] found that people who aren't software
developers but who still program make higher wages than comparable
workers who do not.

However, as Benjamin Doxtdator has [pointed out][doxtdator-jobs], many
of those claims are built on shaky ground. Even if they were true,
education shouldn't prepare people for the jobs of the future: it
should give them the power to decide what kinds of jobs there are, and
to ensure that those jobs are worth doing. And as [Mark Guzdial points
out][guzdial-reasons-to-learn], there are actually many reasons to
learn how to program:

1. To understand our world.

1. To study and understand processes.

1. To be able to ask questions about the influences on their lives.

1. To use an important new form of literacy.

1. To have a new way to learn art, music, science, and mathematics.

1. As a job skill.

1. To use computers better.

1. As a medium in which to learn problem-solving.

Part of what motivates me to teach is the hope that if enough people
understand how to make technology work for them, we will be able to
build a society in which *all* of the reasons above are valued and
rewarded ([s:finale](#CHAPTER)).

## Have a Code of Conduct {#s:intro-code-of-conduct}

The most important thing I've learned about teaching in the last thirty
years is how important it is for everyone to treat everyone else with
respect, both in and out of class. If you use this material in any way,
please adopt a Code of Conduct like the one in [s:conduct](#APPENDIX)
and require everyone who takes part in your classes to abide by it.

A Code of Conduct can't stop people from being offensive, any more than
laws against theft stop people from stealing. What it *can* do is make
expectations and consequences clear. More importantly, having one tells
people that there are rules, and that they can expect a friendly
learning experience.

If someone challenges you about having a Code of Conduct, remind them
that it *isn't* an infringement of free speech. People have a right to
say what they think, but that doesn't mean they have a right to say it
wherever and whenever they want. If they want to make someone feel
unwelcome, they can go and find their own space in which to do it.

## Exercises {#s:intro-exercises}

Each chapter ends with a variety of exercises that include a suggested
format and an indication of how long they usually take in an in-person
setting. Most can be used in other formats---in particular, if you are
going through this book on your own, you can still do many of the
exercises that are described as being for groups---and you can always
spend more time on them than what's suggested.

The exercises in this chapter can be used as preassessment questions
([s:classroom-prior](#SECTION)) rather than as in-class exercises. If
you have learners answer them a few days before a class or workshop
starts, they will give you a much clearer idea of who they are and how
best you can help them.

### Highs and Lows (whole class/5)

Write brief answers to the following questions and share with your
peers. (If you are taking notes together online as described in
[s:classroom-notetaking](#SECTION), put your answers there.)

1. What is the best class or workshop you ever took? What made it so
   good?

1. What was the worst one? What made it so bad?

### Know Thyself (whole class/5)

Write brief answers to the following questions and share them as
described above. Keep your answers somewhere so that you can refer to
them as you go through the rest of this book.

1. What do you most want to teach?

1. Who do you most want to teach?

1. Why do you want to teach?

1. How will you know if you're teaching well?

### Starting Points (individual/5)

Write brief answers to the following questions and share them as
described above. Keep your answers somewhere so that you can refer to
them as you go through the rest of this book.

1. What do you most want to learn about teaching and learning?

1. What is one specific thing you believe is true about teaching and
   learning?

### Why Learn to Program? (individual/20)

Re-read Guzdial's list of reasons to learn to program in
[s:intro-why](#SECTION), then draw a 3x3 grid whose axes are labelled
"low", "medium", and "high" and place each point in one sector
according to how important it is to you (the X axis) and to the people
you plan to teach (the Y axis).

1. Which points are closely aligned in importance (i.e., on the
   diagonal in your grid)?

1. Which points are misaligned (i.e., in the off-diagonal corners)?

1. How does this change what you teach?
