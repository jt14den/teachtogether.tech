title: "Why I Teach"
---

When I first started teaching at the University of Toronto, some of my
students asked me why I was doing it. This was my answer:

> When I was your age, I thought universities existed to teach people
> how to learn. Later, in grad school, I thought universities were about
> doing research and creating new knowledge. Now that I'm in my forties,
> though, I've realized that what we're really teaching you is how to

> to or not.

> My parents are in their seventies. They don't run the world any more;
> it's people my age who pass laws, set interest rates, and make
> life-and-death decisions in hospitals. As scary as it is, *we* are the
> grownups.
> 
> Twenty years from now, though, we'll be heading for retirement and

It was all true, but it wasn't the whole story. I don't want people to
make the world a better place so that I can retire in comfort. I want
them to do it because it's the greatest adventure of our time. A
hundred and fifty years ago, most societies practiced slavery. A
hundred years ago, my grandmother [wasn't legally a
person][famous-five] in Canada. Fifty years ago, most of the world's
people suffered under totalitarian rule; in the year I was born,
judges were still ordering electroshock therapy to "cure"
homosexuals. There's still a lot wrong with the world, but look at how
many more choices we have than our grandparents did. Look at how many
more things we can know, and be, and enjoy.

This didn't happen by chance. It happened because millions of people
made millions of little decisions, the sum of which was a better world.
We don't think of these day-to-day decisions as political, but every
time we buy one brand of running shoe instead of another or shout an
anatomical insult instead of a racial one at a cab driver, we're
choosing one vision of the world instead of another.

In his 1947 essay "[Why I Write][orwell-why]", George Orwell wrote:

Replace "writing" with "teaching" and you'll have the reason I do what I
do. The world doesn't get better on its own. It gets better because
people make it better: penny by penny, vote by vote, and one lesson at a
time. So:

> Start where you are.
> <br/>
> Use what you have.
> <br/>
> Help who you can.

Thank you for reading. I hope we can learn something together some day.
