\begin{center}{\large \textbf{The Rules}}\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Be kind: all else is details.

\item Remember that you are not your learners{\ldots}

\item {\ldots}that most people would rather fail than change{\ldots}

\item {\ldots}and that ninety percent of magic consists of knowing one extra thing.

\item Never teach alone.

\item Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarity.

\item Make every mistake a lesson.

\item Remember that no lesson survives first contact with learners{\ldots}

\item {\ldots}that every lesson is too short from the teacher's point of view and too long from the learner's{\ldots}

\item {\ldots}and that nobody will be more excited about the lesson than you are.

\end{enumerate}
