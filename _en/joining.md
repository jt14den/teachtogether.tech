This appendix describes how you can become part of our community by
using, sharing, and improving this material.

## Contributor Covenant {#s:joining-covenant}

The contributor covenant laid out below governs contributions to this
book. It is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][covenant] version
1.4; please see [s:conduct](#APPENDIX) for a sample code of conduct
for use in classes and other learning situations.

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our
project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

- Focusing on what is best for the community

- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
  attention or advances

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
  attacks

- Public or private harassment

- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or
  electronic address, without explicit permission

- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in
  a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this covenant, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This covenant applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an
official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media
account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or
offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and
clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by contacting the project team at
[{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}). All complaints will be
reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.  The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of
an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be
posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the covenant in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by
other members of the project's leadership.

## Using This Material {#s:joining-using}

This material has been used in many ways, from a multi-week online
class to an intensive in-person workshop. It's usually possible to
cover large parts of [s:models](#CHAPTER) to [s:process](#CHAPTER),
[s:performance](#CHAPTER), and [s:motivation](#CHAPTER) in two long
days.

### In Person

This is the most effective way to deliver this training, but also the
most demanding. Participants are physically together. When they need to
practice teaching in small groups, some or all of them go to nearby
breakout spaces. Participants use their own tablets or laptops to view
online material during the class and for shared note-taking
([s:classroom-notetaking](#SECTION)), and use pen and paper or
whiteboards for other exercises. Questions and discussion are done
aloud.

If you are teaching in this format, you should use sticky notes as
status flags so that you can see who needs help, who has questions,
and who's ready to move on ([s:classroom-status-flags](#SECTION)). You
should also use them to distribute attention so that everyone gets a
fair share of the instructor's time
([s:classroom-attention](#SECTION)), and as minute cards to encourage
learners to reflect on what they've just learned and to give you
actionable feedback while you still have time to act on it
([s:classroom-minute-cards](#SECTION)).

### Online in Groups

In this format, 10--40 learners are together in 2--6 groups of 4--12, but
those groups are geographically distributed. Each group uses one camera
and microphone to connect to the video call, rather than each person
being on the call separately. We have found that having good audio
matters more than having good video, and that the better the audio, the
more learners can communicate with the instructor and other rooms by
voice rather than via text online.

The entire class does shared note-taking together, and also uses the
shared notes for asking and answering questions. (Having several dozen
people try to talk on a call works poorly, so in most sessions, the
instructor does the talking and learners respond through the note-taking
tool's chat.)

### Online as Individuals

The natural extension of being online in groups is to be online as
individuals. As with online groups, the instructor will do most of the
talking and learners will mostly participate via text chat. Good audio
is once again more important than good video, and participants should
use text chat to signal that they want to speak next
([s:meetings](#APPENDIX)).

Having participants online individually makes it more difficult to draw
and share concept maps ([s:memory-exercises](#SECTION)) or give
feedback on teaching ([s:performance-exercises](#SECTION)). Instructors
should therefore rely more on exercises with written results that can be
put in the shared notes, such as giving feedback on stock videos of
people teaching.

### Multi-Week Online

This was the first format used, and I no longer recommend it: while
spreading the class out gives people time to reflect and tackle larger
exercises, it also greatly increases the odds that they'll have to drop
out because of other demands on their time.

The class meets every week for an hour via video conferencing. Each
meeting may be held twice to accommodate learners' time zones and
schedules. Participants use shared note-taking as described above for
online group classes, post homework online between classes, and comment
on each other's work. (In practice, comments are relatively rare: people
strongly prefer to discuss material in the weekly meetings.)

## Contributing and Maintaining {#s:joining-contributing}

This book is a community resource: contributions of all kinds are
welcome, from suggestions for improvements to errata and new material.
All contributors must abide by the contributor covenant presented above;
by submitting your work, you are agreeing that it may incorporated in
either original or edited form and release it under the same license as
the rest of this material ([s:license](#APPENDIX)). If your material is
incorporated, we will add you to the acknowledgments
([s:intro-acknowledgments](#SECTION)) unless you request otherwise.

- The source for this book is stored on GitHub at
  [{{site.repo}}]({{site.repo}}). If you know how to use Git and
  GitHub and would like to change, fix, or add something, please
  submit a [pull request](#g:pull-request) that modifies the LaTeX
  source in the `tex` directory. If you would like to preview your
  changes, please read the instructions in the `BUILD.md` file in the
  root directory of the project.

- If you simply want to report an error, ask a question, or make a
  suggestion, please file an issue at
  [{{site.repo}}]({{site.repo}}). You need to have a GitHub account in
  order to do this, but do not need to know how to use Git.

- If you do not wish to create a GitHub account, please email your
  contribution to [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}) with either
  "T3" or "Teaching Tech Together" somewhere in the subject line. We
  will try to respond within a week.

Please note that we also welcome improvements to our build process,
tooling, and typography, and are always grateful for more diagrams;
please see the file `BUILD.md` in the root directory of the book's
GitHub repository at [{{site.repo}}]({{site.repo}}) for more
information. Finally, we always enjoy hearing how people have used
this material: please let us know if you have a story you would like
to share.

### A Teaching Commons

[s:community-governance](#SECTION) defined a commons as something
managed jointly by a community according to rules they themselves have
evolved and adopted. Open source software and Wikipedia are both
successful examples; the question is, why don't teachers build lessons
collaboratively in the same way? People have proposed [a variety of
reasons][mayer-reasons], but I don't think any of them [hold up to
close scrutiny][wilson-reasons].

[Software Carpentry][swc] is proof by implementation that a teaching
commons can produce and maintain high-quality lessons that hundreds of
people can use [[Wils2016](#CITE)].  I hope you will choose to help us
do the same for this book. If you are new to working this way:

Start small.
: Fix a typo, clarify the wording of an exercise, correct or update a
  citation, or suggest a better example or analogy to illustrate some
  point.

Join the conversation.
: Have a look at the issues and proposed changes that other people
  have already filed and add your comments to them. It's often
  possible to improve improvements, and it's a good way to introduce
  yourself to the community and make new friends. (To make this as
  easy as possible, we tag some issues and proposed changes as
  "Suitable for Newcomers" or "Help Wanted".)

Discuss, then edit.
: If you want to propose a large change, such as reorganizing or
  splitting an entire chapter, please file an issue that outlines your
  proposal and your reasoning and tag it with "Proposal". We encourage
  everyone to add comments to these issues so that the whole
  discussion of what and why is in the open and can be archived. If
  the proposal is accepted, the actual work may then be broken down
  into several smaller issues or changes that can be tackled
  independently.
