Most people are really bad at meetings: they don't have an agenda going
in, they don't take minutes, they waffle on or wander off into
irrelevancies, they repeat what others have said or recite banalities
simply so that they'll have said something, and they hold side
conversations (which pretty much guarantees that the meeting will be a
waste of time). Knowing how to run a meeting efficiently is a core skill
for anyone who wants to get things done. (Knowing how to take part in
someone else's meeting is just as important, but gets far less
attention---as a colleague once said, everyone offers leadership
training, nobody offers followership training.) The most important rules
for making meetings efficient are not secret, but are rarely followed:

Decide if there actually needs to be a meeting.
: If the only purpose is to share information, have everyone send a
  brief email instead. Remember, you can read faster than anyone can
  speak: if someone has facts for the rest of the team to absorb, the
  most polite way to communicate them is to type them in.

Write an agenda.
: If nobody cares enough about the meeting to write a point-form list
  of what's supposed to be discussed, the meeting itself probably
  doesn't need to happen.

Include timings in the agenda.
: Agendas can also help you prevent early items stealing time from
  later ones if you include the time to be spent on each item in the
  agenda. Your first estimates with any new group will be wildly
  optimistic, so revise them upward for subsequent meetings. However,
  you shouldn't plan a second or third meeting because the first one
  ran over-time: instead, try to figure out why you're running over
  and fix the underlying problem.

Prioritize.
: Every meeting is a micro-project, so work should be prioritized in
  the same way that it is for other projects: things that will have
  high impact but take little time should be done first, and things
  that will take lots of time but have little impact should be
  skipped.

Make one person responsible for keeping things moving.
: One person should be tasked with keeping items to time, chiding
  people who are having side conversations or checking email, and
  asking people who are talking too much to get to the point. This
  person should *not* do all the talking; in fact, whoever is in
  charge will talk less in a well-run meeting than most other
  participants.

Require politeness.
: No one gets to be rude, no one gets to ramble, and if someone goes
  off topic, it's the chair's job to say, "Let's discuss that
  elsewhere."

No technology
: (unless it's required for accessibility reasons). Insist that
  everyone put their phones, tablets, and laptops into politeness mode
  (i.e., closes them). If this is too stressful, let participants hang
  on to their electronic pacifiers but turn off the network so that
  they really *are* using them just to take notes or check the agenda.

No interruptions.
: Participants should raise a finger, put up a sticky note, or make
  one of the other gestures people make at high-priced auctions
  instead if they want to speak next. If the speaker doesn't notice
  you, the person in charge ought to.

Record minutes.
: Someone other than the chair should take point-form notes about the
  most important pieces of information that were shared, and about
  every decision that was made or every task that was assigned to
  someone.

Take notes.
: While other people are talking, participants should take notes of
  questions they want to ask or points they want to make. (You'll be
  surprised how smart it makes you look when it's your turn to speak.)

End early.
: If your meeting is scheduled for 10:00-11:00, you should aim to end
  at 10:55 to give people time to get where they need to go next.

As soon as the meeting is over, the minutes should be circulated (e.g.,
emailed to everyone or posted to a wiki):

People who weren't at the meeting can keep track of what's going on.
: You and your fellow students all have to juggle assignments from
  several other courses while doing this project, which means that
  sometimes you won't be able to make it to team meetings. A wiki
  page, email message, or blog entry is a much more efficient way to
  catch up after a missed meeting or two than asking a team mate,
  "Hey, what did I miss?"

Everyone can check what was actually said or promised.
: More than once, I've looked over the minutes of a meeting I was in
  and thought, "Did I say that?" or, "Wait a minute, I didn't promise
  to have it ready then!" Accidentally or not, people will often
  remember things differently; writing it down gives team members a
  chance to correct mistaken or malicious interpretations, which can
  save a lot of anguish later on.

People can be held accountable at subsequent meetings.
: There's no point making lists of questions and action items if you
  don't follow up on them later. If you're using a ticketing system,
  the best thing to do is to create a ticket for each new question or
  task right after the meeting, and update those that are being
  carried forward. That way, your agenda for the next meeting can
  start by rattling through a list of tickets.

[[Brow2007](#CITE)] and [[Broo2016](#CITE)] have lots of good advice on
running meetings, and if you want to "learn, then do", an hour of
training on chairing meetings is the most effective place to start.

## Online Meetings

Chelsea Troy's discussion of [why online meetings are often
frustrating and unproductive][troy-meetings] makes an important point:
in most online meetings, the first person to speak during a pause gets
the floor. The result? "If you have something you want to say, you
have to stop listening to the person currently speaking and instead
focus on when they're gonna pause or finish so you can leap into that
nanosecond of silence and be the first to utter something. The
format...encourages participants who want to contribute to say more
and listen less."

The solution is to run a text chat beside the video conference where
people can signal that they want to speak, and have the moderator select
people from the waiting list. If the meeting is large or argumentative,
this can be reinforced by having everyone mute themselves, and only
allowing the moderator to unmute people.

## The Post Mortem

Every project should end with a post mortem in which you reflect on what
you just accomplished and what you could o better next time. Its aim is
*not* to point the finger of shame at individuals, although if that has
to happen, the post mortem is the best place for it.

A post mortem is run like any other meeting, but with a few additional
guidelines [[Derb2006](#CITE)]:

Get a moderator who wasn't part of the project
: and doesn't have a stake in it. Otherwise, the meeting will either
  go in circles, or focus on only a subset of important topics. In the
  case of student projects, this moderator might be the course
  instructor, or a TA.

Set aside an hour, and only an hour.
: In my experience, nothing useful is said in the first ten minutes of
  anyone's first post mortem, since people are naturally a bit shy
  about praising or damning their own work. Equally, nothing useful is
  said after the first hour: if you're still talking, it's probably
  because one or two people have a *lot* they want to get off their
  chests.

Require attendance.
: Everyone who was part of the project ought to be in the room for the
  post mortem. This is more important than you might think: the people
  who have the most to learn from the post mortem are often least
  likely to show up if the meeting is optional.

Make two lists.
: When I'm moderating, I put the headings "Do Again" and "Do
  Differently" on the board, then do a lap around the room and ask
  every person to give me one item (that hasn't already been
  mentioned) for each list.

Comment on actions, rather than individuals.
: By the time the project is done, some people simply won't be able to
  stand one another. Don't let this sidetrack the meeting: if someone
  has a specific complaint about another member of the team, require
  him to criticize a particular event or decision. "He had a bad
  attitude" does *not* help anyone improve their game.

Once everyone's thoughts are out in the open, organize them somehow so
that you can make specific recommendations about what to do next time.
This list is one of the two major goals of the post mortem (the other
being to give people a chance to be heard).
